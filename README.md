Amplication is an openâ€‘source development tool. It helps professional Node.js developers develop quality Node.js applications without spending time on repetitive coding tasks.

Amplication auto-generates fully functional apps based on TypeScript and Node.js.

## [Getting Started](https://docs.amplication.com/docs/getting-started)

Try amplication immediately on [app.amplication.com](http://app.amplication.com/)
or [follow the instructions](#development) to run a local instance.

## Features

Build business applications with:

- Manage data models visually or through CLI
- Auto-generated human-editable source code
- Node.js server built with Nest.js and Passport with REST API and GraphQL
- Custom code generated app
- Admin UI built with React
- Role-based access control
- Docker and docker-compose integration
- Automatic push of the generated code to your GitHub repo

See [Amplication website](http://amplication.com/) or [Amplication docs](http://docs.amplication.com/) for more details.

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/tKGeLXoPr94) for a quick reacap of everything you get with Amplication.

## Development

Amplication is constructed of multiple packages. To start working on Amplication follow the "Amplication Server" and "Amplication Client" installation instructions.

### [Amplication Server](./packages/amplication-server/README.md)

Amplication Server is the main component of the platform that provides all the core functionality to design and create low-code applications.
The server exposes a GraphQL API for all actions. The server is built with the following awesome open-source technologies: Node.js, NestJS, Prisma over PostgreSQL, GraphQL API, and many more...

### [Amplication Client](./packages/amplication-client/README.md)

Amplication Client is the front end of the platform that provides you with an easy to drive UI for building your next low-code application.
The client is based on React, Apollo client, Primer components, React Material Web Components, Formik, and more.

### [Amplication CLI](./packages/amplication-cli/README.md)

Define your data model and generate apps faster using Amplication Command Line Interface (CLI). Execute pre-defined scripts to create your app instantly.

## Other packages

### [Amplication Data Service Generator](./packages/amplication-data-service-generator/README.md)

Amplication Data Service Generator is the component that generates the code of apps built with Amplication. It generates the models, Prisma client, REST API, GraphQL, authentication and authorization filters, and more. This package is used internally by Amplication server.

To use this package as a library or as a CLI with other projects, follow the instructions on the package page.

## Alpha version

Please note that Amplication is currently in alpha version. <b>This means that any app data hosted on our cloud can get reset at any time.</b> At this point if you want to use your app in a production environment, you'll need to download the app as a Docker container and deploy on your own cloud service.
